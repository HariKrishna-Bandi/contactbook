This is a breif explanation about my code.
===========================================
=>This program allows us to create a contact book to store contacts in contacts.txt file.
=>I have created a contact class to store name, phone number, mail, address of a person.
=>And then I have created a ContactManager class to create functionality.
=>In this contact manager class I created load_contacts function which load the contacts existed in the file.
=>save_contacts function allows us to save a new contact from the add_contacts funtion to contacts.txt file.
=>add_contacts function is used for adding a new contact.
=>view_all_contacts function is helpful to view all the existing contacts in the contact book.
=>finally search_contact and delete_contact functions are used to search and
delete a contact from contacts.txt file respectively.
=>And Now I have used main() function outside of the class which helps to take user-input
and to use the user-defined commands to show the output.

challenges I have encountered
==============================
=>I have written the code with minor errors and resolved it after finding it soon.
=>But the real challenges I have faced during the setup of functionality part.
=>when I wanted to create one functionality the other functionality keeps stopped working
=>And finally I learnt from mistakes and recovered this code without any mistakes.
=>This current code is working well with all the functionalities.
